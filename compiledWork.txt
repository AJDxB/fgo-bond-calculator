FGO Bond Calculator - Project Compiled Work Log
====================================================

Project History & Motivation
---------------------------
- **Origin:** Created to address the lack of reliable, up-to-date, and user-friendly FGO bond calculators, especially for global players who need accurate quest/bonus data and modern UI/UX.
- **Main Contributor:** AJDxB (ajdxb4787@gmail.com). See GitHub contributors for others.
- **Inspiration:** Community feedback, Atlas Academy data, and the need for a tool that supports new FGO features and bonuses.
- **Notable Forks/Inspiration:** Inspired by other FGO calculators, but built from scratch for maintainability and extensibility.

Detailed Component Descriptions
------------------------------
- **App.js**: Root React component. Handles theme switching (dark/light), server selection (NA/JP), layout, and renders the main calculator. Manages global state for theme and server choice, loads appropriate servant data file, and passes props to children.
- **RunsCalculator.js**: Core logic for bond calculation. Handles user input (servant, bond points, quest, bonuses), performs calculations, and displays results. Contains logic for bonus stacking (additive/multiplicative), quest selection, and custom points mode. Manages state for all calculator fields.
- **RunsCalculator.css**: Styles for the calculator, including responsive design, bonus UI, and theme support. Contains custom classes for all calculator UI elements and adapts to mobile/desktop.
- **App.css**: Global styles for the app, including layout, typography, and theme variables.
- **servants.json**: Local data file with all servant info (id, name, class, rarity, bond points, etc.), updated via GitHub Actions for speed and reliability.
- **fetch_quests.js / fetch_servants.js**: Node scripts to fetch and update quest/servant data from Atlas Academy. Used in CI/CD and for manual updates.
- **public/**: Static assets (images, icons, manifest, etc.) for deployment. Includes class icons, logos, and manifest files for PWA support.
- **ServantClassImages/**: Contains all class icons, organized by rarity (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for use in the UI.

Data Flow & Architecture
------------------------
- **Data Fetching:** Servant and quest data is fetched from Atlas Academy and stored locally in `public/servants.json` and internal quest data files. Data is updated via GitHub Actions and fetch scripts.
- **State Management:** Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state. No external state management library.
- **Calculation Logic:** All bond/quest/bonus calculations are performed in RunsCalculator.js. Bonus stacking is handled according to FGO rules (additive for most, multiplicative for Heroic Portrait/Frontline).
- **Theming:** Theme (dark/light) is managed via CSS variables and localStorage. User preference is persisted across sessions.
- **UI Rendering:** Responsive design using CSS clamp(), flexbox, and grid. All UI adapts to mobile and desktop.

Detailed Data Flow Description
-----------------------------
- **Overview:**
    - The FGO Bond Calculator app processes data through several key stages: data fetching, local storage, state management, calculation, and UI rendering. This section provides a step-by-step description of how data flows from source to user interface.

1. **Data Fetching and Preparation:**
    - **Servant Data:**
        - The app now supports both NA and JP servers with separate data files:
            - `fetch_servants.js` retrieves NA server data and saves to `public/servants.json`
            - `fetch_servants_jp.js` retrieves JP server data and saves to `public/servants_jp.json`
        - Each script processes and filters data from the Atlas Academy API, keeping only the fields required by the app (e.g., id, name, class, rarity, bond points, traits).
        - The scripts are run both manually (by maintainers) and automatically (via GitHub Actions) to keep both NA and JP data up to date.
        - Users can switch between NA and JP data using a server selection toggle in the UI.
    - **Quest Data:**
        - Quest data (AP cost, base bond points, etc.) is hardcoded in `RunsCalculator.js` as a constant object, since it changes infrequently and is small in size.

2. **App Initialization:**
    - On app load, React components are initialized.
    - The main component (`App.js`) sets up global state (e.g., theme) and renders the calculator UI.
    - The `RunsCalculator.js` component loads servant data from `public/servants.json` (served as a static asset) and quest data from its internal constant.

3. **User Interaction and State Management:**
    - The user selects a servant, target bond level, and quest type, or enters custom bond/AP values.
    - The user enters any bond bonus percentages (CE, event, etc.) and toggles Heroic Portrait and Frontline bonuses.
    - All user inputs are managed via React `useState` hooks within `RunsCalculator.js`.
    - When any input changes, a `useEffect` hook triggers recalculation of results.

4. **Calculation Logic:**
    - The calculator determines the base bond points per run from the selected quest or custom input.
    - It applies additive percentage bonuses, then flat bonuses (Heroic Portrait), then multiplicative bonuses (Frontline), following the documented order of operations.
    - The number of runs, total AP, bond per run, and estimated time are computed.
    - Results are stored in local component state.

5. **UI Rendering:**
    - The calculator UI displays the current servant, quest, bonuses, and calculated results.
    - All results update in real time as the user changes inputs.
    - The UI uses CSS for responsive design and theming, adapting to mobile and desktop.

6. **Data Update Flow:**
    - When new servants are released or data needs updating, maintainers run `fetch_servants.js` or wait for the scheduled GitHub Action.
    - The updated `servants.json` is committed and pushed to the repository, and deployed to GitHub Pages.
    - The app automatically serves the latest data on next load.

**Summary Table:**
| Stage                | Source/Trigger                | Data Location           | Consumed By           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Fetch NA Servants    | fetch_servants.js, GitHub CI  | public/servants.json   | RunsCalculator.js     |
| Fetch JP Servants    | fetch_servants_jp.js, CI      | public/servants_jp.json| RunsCalculator.js     |
| Fetch Quests         | Hardcoded in code             | RunsCalculator.js      | RunsCalculator.js     |
| User Input           | UI (React forms)              | React state            | RunsCalculator.js     |
| Calculation          | useEffect in RunsCalculator   | React state            | RunsCalculator.js     |
| UI Rendering         | React render cycle            | React state            | User (browser)        |
| Data Update/Deploy   | Maintainer/CI                 | public/servants.json   | All users             |

- **Note:** All calculations and data processing are performed client-side. No user data is stored or transmitted.

Deployment & CI/CD
------------------
- **Deployment:** Uses `gh-pages` npm package to deploy the build to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting. The homepage is set in package.json.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow runs twice daily to fetch and update servant data. Workflow files are in `.github/workflows/` (not shown above, but present in repo).
- **Common Issues:** Tag conflicts (e.g., v0.3.1 already exists) can block deployment. Solution: delete the remote tag before redeploying.
- **PowerShell Policy:** On Windows, set execution policy to RemoteSigned for npm scripts to work: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`.
- **Manual Data Update:** Run fetch_quests.js or fetch_servants.js to update data locally, then commit and push.

Testing
-------
- **Test Files:** Located in `src/` (e.g., App.test.js, setupTests.js). Uses React Testing Library and Jest.
- **How to Run:** `npm test` runs all tests. Tests cover component rendering and basic logic.
- **Coverage:** Basic coverage for UI and calculation logic. No e2e tests. More tests recommended for edge cases and bonus stacking.

Known Issues & TODOs
--------------------
- **Deployment:** Tag conflicts with gh-pages. Always check for existing tags before deploying.
- **Data Updates:** Atlas Academy API changes may break fetch scripts. Monitor API changes.
- **UI/UX:** Some advanced FGO bonuses/events not yet supported. UI could be further improved for accessibility.
- **Testing:** Increase test coverage, especially for calculation edge cases.
- **Performance:** Large data files may slow down initial load on slow connections.
- **Feature Requests:** See GitHub Issues for open requests and suggestions.

User & Contributor Guidance
---------------------------
- **Request Features/Bugs:** Use GitHub Issues for all requests and bug reports.
- **Add New Quests/Servants:** Update the relevant data files (servants.json, quest data) and commit changes. Use fetch scripts for bulk updates.
- **Update Dependencies:** Use `npm update` and test thoroughly before deploying.
- **Pull Requests:** Fork, branch, and submit PRs with clear descriptions. Follow code style and include tests if possible.

External Integrations
---------------------
- **Atlas Academy API:** Used for all servant and quest data.
    - All endpoints, usage instructions, and data structure are documented at: https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs
    - Always consult the official documentation for the latest endpoints and query parameters.
    - Note: The app's fetch scripts are configured to use the recommended endpoints from the docs; update scripts as needed if the API changes.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates data updates and can be extended for CI/CD.

UI/UX Design
------------
- **Design Rationale:** Focus on clarity, speed, and mobile-friendliness. Dropdowns for all selections, styled bonus multipliers, and clear result displays.
- **Accessibility:** Uses semantic HTML and ARIA labels where possible. Further improvements possible.
- **Adding UI Features:** Add new components to src/, update CSS, and test on both mobile and desktop.

Versioning & Tagging
--------------------
- **Tagging:** Tags are created for each release (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.). Use `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
- **Release Process:** Update version in package.json, App.js, and other relevant files. Update changelog in README.md. Tag and deploy.
- **Naming Conventions:** Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).

Security & Privacy
------------------
- **User Data:** No user data is stored or transmitted. All calculations are client-side.
- **Data Updates:** Only maintainers can trigger GitHub Actions for data updates.
- **Dependencies:** Kept up to date to avoid vulnerabilities.

fetch_servants.js Usage
----------------------
- **Purpose:** Downloads the latest FGO servant data from Atlas Academy and saves it locally as `public/servants.json` for use by the app.
- **How to Run:**
    - Open a terminal in the project root directory.
    - Run the script with Node.js:
      ```powershell
      node fetch_servants.js
      ```
- **What It Does:**
    - Fetches servant data from the Atlas Academy API (see https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs for the current endpoint).
    - Processes and filters the data to include only the fields required by the app (e.g., id, name, class, rarity, bond points, etc.).
    - Saves the processed data to `public/servants.json`.
- **Output:**
    - Overwrites `public/servants.json` with the latest servant data.
- **Configuration:**
    - No environment variables or arguments are required by default.
    - If the API endpoint changes, update the URL in `fetch_servants.js`.
- **Troubleshooting:**
    - If the script fails, check:
        - Your internet connection.
        - That the Atlas Academy API is online and the endpoint is correct.
        - That you have write permissions to the `public/` directory.
    - If the API structure changes, update the script to match the new data format.
- **When to Use:**
    - Run this script whenever you want to update the local servant data (e.g., after new servants are released or for regular maintenance).
    - The script is also run automatically by GitHub Actions for scheduled updates.

GitHub Actions Workflow Details
------------------------------
- **Workflow Files:** Located in `.github/workflows/` (e.g., `update-servants.yml`).
- **Purpose:** Automates the process of updating local servant data by running `fetch_servants.js` on a schedule or on demand.
- **Triggers:**
    - **Scheduled:** Runs automatically at set intervals (e.g., twice daily) to fetch the latest servant data.
    - **Manual:** Can be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab if immediate update is needed.
    - **On Push:** May also run on push to main or specific branches (if configured).
- **Steps Performed:**
    1. **Checkout:** Checks out the repository code.
    2. **Set Up Node.js:** Installs the required Node.js version (see `package.json` for version).
    3. **Install Dependencies:** Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies cleanly.
    4. **Run fetch_servants.js:** Executes the script to fetch and update `public/servants.json`.
    5. **Commit & Push:** If there are changes to `public/servants.json`, commits and pushes them back to the repository.
    6. **(Optional) Deploy:** May trigger deployment to GitHub Pages if configured.
- **Secrets & Permissions:**
    - Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a personal access token with repo write permissions to push changes.
    - No external secrets are required for public Atlas Academy API access.
- **Logs & Troubleshooting:**
    - Workflow logs are available in the GitHub Actions tab for each run.
    - If the workflow fails, check logs for API errors, permission issues, or script errors.
- **Customization:**
    - To change the schedule, edit the `cron` expression in the workflow YAML file.
    - To add more steps (e.g., run tests, deploy), modify the workflow as needed.

Servant Data Structure Example
-----------------------------
- The local servant data is stored in `public/servants.json` as an array of servant objects.
- Each servant object contains only the fields required by the app for bond calculation and display.
- **Example servant object:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 100100,
    "name": "Artoria Pendragon",
    "className": "Saber",
    "rarity": 5,
    "bondPoints": [500, 1500, 3000, 5000, 7000, 15000, 20000, 30000, 40000],
    "traits": ["King", "Arthur", "Dragon"]
  }
  ```
- **Field descriptions:**
    - `id`: Unique servant ID (number).
    - `name`: Servant's display name (string).
    - `className`: FGO class (e.g., "Saber", "Archer") (string).
    - `rarity`: Star rarity (number, 1-5).
    - `bondPoints`: Array of cumulative bond points required for each bond level (array of numbers).
    - `traits`: Array of trait strings (optional, used for filtering or bonus logic).
- **Note:** The actual fields may vary slightly depending on the current needs of the app. Check `fetch_servants.js` and `RunsCalculator.js` for the latest structure and usage.

Bonus Calculation Logic
----------------------
- **Overview:**
    - The app supports multiple types of bond point bonuses, including Craft Essences (CEs), Heroic Portrait, and Frontline Bonus.
    - Users can select and stack bonuses using the UI toggles and input fields in the Runs Calculator.
- **Types of Bonuses:**
    - **Craft Essence (CE) Bonus:** Additive percentage bonus. User enters the CE bond bonus percentage manually in the Bond Bonus (%) input field.
    - **Event/Other Additive Bonuses:** Any event or campaign bonuses are also added additively as percentages if present (entered manually).
    - **Heroic Portrait Bonus:** Flat additive bonus. If selected, adds +50 bond points per copy (multiplied by the number selected) after percentage-based additive bonuses, before multiplicative bonuses.
    - **Frontline Bonus:** Multiplicative bonus. If selected, multiplies the total bond points after all additive bonuses (including Heroic Portrait).
- **Order of Operations:**
    1. **Base bond points** are determined by the selected quest.
    2. **Additive percentage bonuses** (CE, event, etc.) are summed and applied to the base bond points.
    3. **Flat bonuses** (Heroic Portrait: +50 per copy) are added to the result from step 2.
    4. **Multiplicative bonuses** (Frontline, etc.) are applied to the sum from step 3.
    5. The final bond points per run are rounded/floored as per FGO rules (if applicable).
- **UI Implementation:**
    - Users enter CE and event bonuses as a percentage in the Bond Bonus (%) input field, and select Heroic Portrait and Frontline bonuses using toggles and dropdowns.
    - The UI displays the total bonus applied and the resulting bond points per run.
    - Bonus multipliers and their effects are visually indicated for clarity.
- **Edge Cases:**
    - If multiple multiplicative bonuses are selected, they are multiplied together (e.g., 1.1 × 1.2 = 1.32x total multiplier).
    - If no bonuses are selected, only the base bond points are used.
    - The app ensures that bonuses are not double-counted and that only valid combinations are allowed.
- **Maintenance:**
    - Bonus values and stacking logic are defined in `RunsCalculator.js`.
    - If FGO introduces new bonus types or changes stacking rules, update the logic in `RunsCalculator.js` and the UI as needed.
